# ESP8266 light switch
Some code I wrote one afternoon after getting annoyed by the need to grab my phone to turn off my lights, pretty much the same reason https://github.com/LevitatingBusinessMan/yeelight-cli exists.

### Setup
Check the `#define` lines in the code for configuration.
Use gpio pin 2 as led to use the onboard led on a NodeMCU v3.

### Images
My soldering equipment probably cost me 5 dollars total, don't judge me.
